## ðŸ“Š What to Monitor During Testing

### 1. **Dev Data Manager Tab**
- Switch to the "Dev Data Manager" tab in main-editor
- Click "Refresh" after each message
- You should see:
  - Engagements count increasing
  - Documents count increasing  
  - S3 objects appearing
  - Total size growing

### 2. **Backend Logs Tab**
- Check the "Backend Logs" tab
- Look for:
  - File structure operations
  - DynamoDB operations
  - S3 operations
  - Success/error messages

### 3. **Network Tab (Browser DevTools)**
- Open browser DevTools â†’ Network tab
- Watch for API calls to:
  - `/api/v1/file-structure/*`
  - `/api/agents/chat`
  - Backend WebSocket connections

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If Agent Doesn't Respond:
1. Check Backend Logs tab for errors
2. Verify backend server is running: http://localhost:8000/docs
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### If File Operations Fail:
1. Check AWS credentials in backend/.env.local
2. Verify DynamoDB tables exist
3. Check S3 bucket permissions

### If Dev Data Manager Shows No Data:
1. Click "Refresh" button
2. Check if Clerk authentication is working
3. Verify API endpoints are accessible

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

âœ… **Agent responds naturally to each message**  
âœ… **File structure operations complete successfully**

## ðŸš€ Advanced Testing (After Basic Script)

```

```
Rename the "Bank Statements" folder to "Banking Documents"
```

```
Delete the Q1 folder and then restore it from trash
```

```
Create a complex nested structure: Documents/Tax Year 2024/Federal/Forms/1040
```

**Ready to test!** ðŸŽ¯

1. Make sure backend is running (âœ… confirmed above)
2. Open frontend in browser
3. Go to chat interface  
4. Start with Message 1 and work through sequentially
5. Monitor the Dev Data Manager tab between messages
6. Check Backend Logs for any issues

The system should create a complete file structure in real-time as you chat!
