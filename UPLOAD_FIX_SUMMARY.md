# Upload Fix Summary

## ✅ **FIXED: Maximum Call Stack Size Exceeded**

### 🔍 **Root Cause:**
The "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error was caused by two issues:

1. **Circular Reference**: `handleFileUpload` was calling `sendAgentMessage`, which could create an infinite loop
2. **Large File Base64 Encoding**: Using `btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(fileBuffer)))` with large files causes call stack overflow

### 🔧 **Solutions Applied:**

#### 1. **Removed Circular Reference**
**Before:**
```javascript
// This could cause infinite recursion
const uploadMessage = `I just uploaded: ${fileNames}. Please process them.`;
await sendAgentMessage(uploadMessage);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Safe success notification
alert(`✅ Successfully uploaded: ${fileNames}\n\nYou can now tell the agent about your uploaded files.`);
```

#### 2. **Fixed Base64 Encoding for Large Files**
**Before:**
```javascript
// This causes call stack overflow with large files
const base64Content = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(fileBuffer)));
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Safe chunked base64 encoding
let base64Content = '';
const chunkSize = 8192;
for (let i = 0; i < uint8Array.length; i += chunkSize) {
  const chunk = uint8Array.slice(i, i + chunkSize);
  base64Content += btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, Array.from(chunk)));
}
```

#### 3. **Added File Size Limit**
```javascript
// Prevent memory issues with huge files
if (file.size > 10 * 1024 * 1024) {
  throw new Error(`File ${file.name} is too large. Maximum size is 10MB.`);
}
```

### 🎯 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Backend Running**: Port 8000 with simple upload endpoint
- ✅ **Upload Endpoint**: `/api/v1/simple-upload/upload` working
- ✅ **Frontend Fixed**: No more call stack errors
- ✅ **File Size Protection**: 10MB limit to prevent memory issues
- ✅ **Safe Base64 Encoding**: Chunked processing for large files

### 📋 **Test Steps:**
1. **Open Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Go to Chat**: Start conversation with agent
3. **Drag & Drop File**: Any PDF/image under 10MB
4. **Expected Result**: 
   - Success alert: "✅ Successfully uploaded: [filename]"
   - No call stack errors
   - File uploaded to S3

### 🚀 **Ready for Testing!**
The drag-and-drop upload is now stable and working without recursion issues.
