## üìù **Expected Agent Responses**

The agent should respond with:
- ‚úÖ Conversational acknowledgments
- ‚úÖ Tool usage notifications (e.g., "Tool #1: manage_state_tool")
- ‚úÖ Tax calculations with breakdowns
- ‚úÖ Version information (e.g., "Version v1 created")
- ‚úÖ Form filling confirmations with field counts
- ‚úÖ Version history with timestamps and file sizes
- ‚úÖ Download URLs for completed forms
- ‚úÖ Next step suggestions

## üö® **What to Watch For**

### **Success Indicators:**
- Agent uses tools (you'll see "Tool #X: tool_name")
- Forms show "Successfully filled X form widgets"
- Version numbers increment (v1 ‚Üí v2 ‚Üí v3)
- File sizes change when content is updated
- Download URLs are provided
- Conversation state is maintained

### **Potential Issues:**
- "ModuleNotFoundError" - backend not running properly
- "0 form widgets filled" - form filling not working
- No version information - versioning system issue
- Agent doesn't use tools - Strands SDK integration problem
