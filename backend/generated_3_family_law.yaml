    \nIN THE MATTER OF                           \xA7     IN THE DISTRICT COURT\n\
    THE MARRIAGE OF                            \xA7\n                            \
    \               \xA7\n[PETITIONER_NAME]                          \xA7\nAND   \
    \                                     \xA7     [COURT_NUMBER] JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n\
    [RESPONDENT_NAME]                          \xA7\n                            \
    \               \xA7\nAND IN THE INTEREST OF                     \xA7\n[CHILD_NAME],\
    \ A CHILD                      \xA7     [COUNTY_NAME] COUNTY, TEXAS\n\nORIGINAL\
    \ PETITION FOR DIVORCE\n\n1. Discovery Level\n   Discovery in this case is intended\
    \ to be conducted under Level 2 of Rule 190 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\
    \n2. Parties\n   This suit is brought by [PETITIONER_NAME], Petitioner.\n\n3.\
    \ Domicile\n   Petitioner has been a domiciliary of Texas for the preceding six-month\
    \ period and a resident of this county for the preceding ninety-day period.\n\n\
    4. Service\n   Process should be served on Respondent at [RESPONDENT_ADDRESS].\n\
    \n5. Protective Order Statement\n   [Include statement about whether a protective\
    \ order is in effect or an application for protective order is pending]\n\n6.\
    \ Dates of Marriage and Separation\n   The parties were married on or about [MARRIAGE_DATE]\
    \ and ceased to live together as husband and wife on or about [SEPARATION_DATE].\n\
    \n7. Grounds for Divorce\n   The marriage has become insupportable because of\
    \ discord or conflict of personalities between Petitioner and Respondent that\
    \ destroys the legitimate ends of the marriage relationship and prevents any reasonable\
    \ expectation of reconciliation.\n\n8. Children of the Marriage\n   Petitioner\
    \ and Respondent are parents of the following children of this marriage who are\
    \ not under the continuing jurisdiction of any other court:\n   \n   Name: [CHILD_NAME]\n\
    \   Sex: [CHILD_SEX]\n   Birth date: [CHILD_BIRTHDATE]\n\n9. Division of Community\
    \ Property\n   Petitioner believes Petitioner and Respondent will enter into an\
    \ agreement for the division of their estate. If such an agreement is made, Petitioner\
    \ requests the Court to approve the agreement and divide their estate in a manner\
    \ consistent with the agreement. If such an agreement is not made, Petitioner\
    \ requests the Court to divide their estate in a manner that the Court deems just\
    \ and right, as provided by law.\n\n10. Reimbursement\n    Petitioner requests\
    \ the Court to reimburse Petitioner's separate estate for funds or assets expended\
    \ by Petitioner's separate estate for payment of unsecured liabilities of Respondent's\
    \ separate estate. Those expenditures resulted in a direct benefit to Respondent's\
    \ separate estate. Petitioner's separate estate has not been adequately compensated\
    \ for or benefited from the expenditure of those funds or assets, and a failure\
    \ by the Court to allow reimbursement to Petitioner's separate estate will result\
    \ in an unjust enrichment of Respondent's separate estate at the expense of Petitioner's\
    \ separate estate.\n\n11. Request for Temporary Orders\n    Petitioner requests\
    \ the Court, after notice and hearing, to dispense with the issuance of a bond,\
    \ to make temporary orders and issue any appropriate temporary injunctions for\
    \ the preservation of the property and protection of the parties and for the safety\
    \ and welfare of the children of the marriage as deemed necessary and equitable.\
    \ Petitioner requests that the Court make temporary orders and issue any appropriate\
    \ temporary injunctions respecting the temporary conservatorship of the children\
    \ of the marriage.\n\n12. Attorney's Fees, Expenses, Costs, and Interest\n   \
    \ It was necessary for Petitioner to secure the services of [ATTORNEY_NAME], a\
    \ licensed attorney, to prepare and prosecute this suit. To effect an equitable\
    \ division of the estate of the parties and as a part of the division, and for\
    \ services rendered in connection with conservatorship and support of the children,\
    \ judgment for attorney's fees, expenses, and costs through trial and appeal should\
    \ be granted against Respondent and in favor of Petitioner for the use and benefit\
    \ of Petitioner's attorney and be ordered paid directly to Petitioner's attorney,\
    \ who may enforce the judgment in the attorney's own name. Petitioner requests\
    \ postjudgment interest as allowed by law.\n\n13. Prayer\n    Petitioner prays\
    \ that citation and notice issue as required by law and that the Court grant a\
    \ divorce and all other relief requested in this petition.\n    \n    Petitioner\
    \ prays for general relief.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[ATTORNEY_SIGNATURE]\n\
