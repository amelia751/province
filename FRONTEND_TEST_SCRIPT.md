## Auto-Reload Test

**Purpose**: Verify the form auto-reloads when new versions are created

**Test Steps**:
1. Click "Reset Forms (1040)" button
2. Wait for confirmation
3. Start conversation again from STEP 2
4. **Watch the Form 1040 tab carefully**
5. You should see the PDF viewer automatically reload every time the agent fills a new version

**Expected Behavior**:
- Console logs: `üîÑ New form version detected!`
- PDF viewer should smoothly transition to new version
- Version counter should update (v001 ‚Üí v002 ‚Üí v003...)
- NO page flickering or reloading unless there's a new version

**If Reloading Too Often**:
- Check browser console for logs
- Should only reload when version count increases
- Should NOT reload every 5 seconds if no new version

## Troubleshooting

### W-2 Processing Fails
**Symptom**: Agent says "There was an issue processing the W2 document"  
**Fix**: 
1. Check Bedrock role permissions in AWS Console
2. See `BEDROCK_W2_PROCESSING_FIX.md`
3. Wait 60 seconds and try again

### Form Not Auto-Loading
**Symptom**: Form 1040 tab shows "No Form 1040 Available"  
**Fix**:
1. Check Debug Info tab ‚Üí USER_ID (should be your Clerk ID)
2. Click manual refresh button (‚Üª)
3. Check console for API errors

### Wrong Checkbox Checked
**Symptom**: "Married filing jointly" checked instead of "Single"  
**Fix**:
1. Copy Debug Info (full text)
2. Share with developer
3. Check DynamoDB mapping for filing status fields

### Form Reloads Every 5 Seconds
**Symptom**: PDF keeps reloading even when idle  
**Fix**:
1. Check browser console for logs
2. Should see "No changes detected" message
3. If still reloading, check `form-1040-viewer.tsx` for stale closure

### Banking Info Not Filled
**Symptom**: Routing/account numbers missing  
**Fix**:
1. Check if you said "checking" or "savings"
2. Agent needs explicit account type
3. Retry with full sentence

## Expected Timeline

| Step | Time | Cumulative |
|------|------|------------|
| Upload W-2 | 5s | 5s |
| Bedrock Processing | 30-60s | 35-65s |
| Filing Status | 10s | 45-75s |

## Notes

- **Auto-Refresh**: Form checks for new versions every 5 seconds
- **Polling**: Bedrock waits up to 3 minutes for processing
- **Version Numbers**: May not be sequential if you're retesting
- **Cache Busting**: Each PDF has unique URL to prevent browser caching
- **PII Safety**: All forms saved under Clerk user ID, not name

---

## End of Test
