# Tax System Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

### 1. DynamoDB Tables Created
Successfully created all required DynamoDB tables for the tax system:

- **province-tax-engagements**: Stores tax engagement/matter data
- **province-tax-documents**: Stores document metadata and S3 references  
- **province-tax-permissions**: Manages user permissions for engagements
- **province-tax-deadlines**: Stores tax filing deadlines and reminders
- **province-tax-connections**: Manages agent session connections (with TTL)

All tables include appropriate GSIs for efficient querying.

### 2. Tax Agent Architecture Implemented
Created a complete tax-focused agent system with 8 specialized agents:

#### **TaxPlanner** (Router/Orchestrator)
- Routes user requests to appropriate specialized agents
- Enforces "simple W-2-only" scope limitations
- Maintains engagement state and workflow progression
- Provides clear guidance throughout the process

#### **TaxIntakeAgent**
- Collects filing status, dependents, address/ZIP, bank info
- Validates information completeness and accuracy
- Writes `/Intake/Organizer.md` from chat answers
- Friendly conversational interface

#### **W2IngestAgent**
- OCR parsing of W-2 PDFs using AWS Textract
- Normalizes data into structured JSON with pin-cites
- Aggregates multiple W-2s automatically
- Validates totals and flags anomalies

#### **Calc1040Agent**
- Deterministic tax calculation using 2025 tax brackets
- Applies standard deduction based on filing status
- Computes Child Tax Credit for qualifying dependents
- Emits machine-readable calculation results

#### **ReviewAgent**
- Generates plain-English summaries of tax calculations
- Explains income, deductions, tax, credits, withholding
- Inserts footnotes with pin-cites to source documents
- Creates missing information checklists

#### **ReturnRenderAgent**
- Generates PDF 1040 forms from calculation data
- Fills official form templates with calculated values
- Embeds provenance information for audit trails
- Saves draft PDFs ready for review

#### **DeadlinesAgent**
- Calculates federal filing deadlines (April 15 + adjustments)
- Creates .ics calendar files with reminders
- Handles weekend/holiday adjustments
- Includes extension information (Form 4868)

#### **ComplianceAgent**
- Scans documents for PII (SSNs, bank numbers, etc.)
- Suggests redaction for summaries (SSN to last-4)
- Blocks sharing if high-risk PII detected
- Requires user approval before document release

### 3. Tax Tools Implemented
Created comprehensive tool suite for tax operations:

- **save_document**: Saves documents to S3 with DynamoDB metadata
- **get_signed_url**: Generates pre-signed URLs for uploads/downloads
- **ingest_w2_pdf**: Textract-powered W-2 data extraction
- **calc_1040_simple**: Complete tax calculation engine
- **render_1040_draft**: PDF generation for tax forms
- **create_deadline**: Calendar event creation with reminders
- **pii_scan**: Privacy compliance scanning

### 4. Data Models and Constants
- Complete Pydantic models for all tax data structures
- 2025 tax year constants (brackets, deductions, credits)
- Proper enum definitions for filing status, document types
- Validation logic for tax calculations

### 5. Folder Structure
Implemented the exact folder structure you specified:
```
/<Last>_<First>_1040_2025
  /Intake
    Organizer.md
  /Documents
    W2/
    Prior_Year/
  /Workpapers
    W2_Extracts.json
    Calc_1040_Simple.json
  /Returns
    1040_Draft.pdf
  /Deadlines
    Federal.ics
  /Correspondence
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Your Attention

### 1. AWS IAM Permissions
The current AWS user (`province`) needs additional permissions to deploy Bedrock agents:

**Required IAM Permissions:**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:CreateAgent",
                "bedrock:CreateAgentAlias",
                "bedrock:CreateAgentActionGroup",
                "bedrock:PrepareAgent",
                "bedrock:ListAgents",
                "bedrock:GetAgent",
                "iam:CreateRole",
                "iam:PutRolePolicy",
                "iam:GetRole",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "lambda:CreateFunction",
                "lambda:InvokeFunction"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 2. Bedrock Agent Service Role
You need to create an IAM role for Bedrock agents to assume:

**Role Name**: `BedrockAgentRole`
**Trust Policy**: Allow `bedrock.amazonaws.com` to assume the role
**Permissions**: Access to invoke models, Lambda functions, S3, and DynamoDB

### 3. Lambda Function for Tools
The agents need a Lambda function to execute their tools. This function should:
- Handle all the tax tools (save_document, ingest_w2_pdf, etc.)
- Have proper IAM permissions for S3, DynamoDB, Textract
- Be deployed in the same region (us-east-2)

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Option 1: Manual Setup (Recommended)
1. **Add IAM permissions** to the `province` user for Bedrock operations
2. **Create the BedrockAgentRole** IAM role with appropriate permissions
3. **Deploy a Lambda function** for tool execution
4. **Run the agent deployment script**: `python scripts/deploy_tax_agents.py`

### Option 2: Dashboard Setup
If you prefer to use the AWS Bedrock console:
1. Go to AWS Bedrock ‚Üí Agents
2. Create agents manually using the instructions and tool definitions provided
3. Configure action groups pointing to your Lambda function

## üìã Testing Checklist

Once deployed, test the system with this workflow:

1. **Create Tax Engagement**: User starts new 2025 tax return
2. **Upload W-2**: System processes PDF and extracts data
3. **Collect Intake**: System gathers filing status, dependents, etc.
4. **Calculate Tax**: System computes refund/amount due
5. **Generate Return**: System creates draft 1040 PDF
6. **Create Deadlines**: System adds filing deadline to calendar
7. **Review & Approve**: User reviews summary and approves for download

## üîß Configuration Files

The system is configured to use:
- **S3 Bucket**: `province-documents-storage`
- **Region**: `us-east-2`
- **Model**: `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0`
- **Tables**: All `province-tax-*` tables created and ready

## üìû Support

All code is implemented and ready to deploy. The main blocker is AWS permissions. Once you have the IAM permissions sorted out, the agents should deploy successfully and be ready for testing.

The system is designed exactly to your specifications:
- ‚úÖ Simple W-2 employee returns only
- ‚úÖ Standard deduction applied
- ‚úÖ Plain-English summaries with citations
- ‚úÖ .ics deadline files
- ‚úÖ Export-ready PDFs (no e-file)
- ‚úÖ PII scanning and approval gates
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trails

Let me know when you have the permissions set up and I can help with the final deployment!
