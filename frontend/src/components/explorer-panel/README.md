## Usage

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { EnhancedExplorerPanel } from '@/components/explorer-panel';

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <EnhancedExplorerPanel
      currentPracticeArea="legal"
      onMatterSelect={(matter) => console.log('Selected:', matter.name)}
      onDocumentSelect={(doc, matterId) => console.log('Open document:', doc.name)}
      onAIAction={(action) => console.log('AI Action:', action.action.label)}
      onChatRequest={(request) => console.log('Chat:', request.request)}
    />
  );
}
```

### With State Management Hook

```tsx
import { EnhancedExplorerPanel, useExplorerState } from '@/components/explorer-panel';

function MyApp() {
  const explorerState = useExplorerState({
    initialPracticeArea: 'legal',
    onMatterSelect: (matter) => {
      // Handle matter selection
      openMatterInEditor(matter);
    },
    onDocumentSelect: (document, matterId) => {
      // Handle document selection
      openDocumentInEditor(document);
    },
    onAIAction: (action) => {
      // Handle AI actions
      executeAIAction(action);
    },
    onChatRequest: (request) => {
      // Handle chat requests
      sendToChatPanel(request);
    }
  });

  return (
    <EnhancedExplorerPanel
      currentPracticeArea="legal"
      onMatterSelect={explorerState.selectMatter}
      onDocumentSelect={explorerState.selectDocument}
      onAIAction={explorerState.executeAIAction}
      onChatRequest={explorerState.sendChatRequest}
    />
  );
}
```
