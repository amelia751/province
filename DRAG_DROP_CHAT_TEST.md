# Drag & Drop Chat Upload Test Script

âœ… **Reverted agent-triggered uploads** - Removed unsafe upload dialog approach  
âœ… **Updated agent prompt** - Agent now tells users to drag-drop files in chat  
âœ… **Implemented drag-drop** - Chat input area now supports file uploads  

## ðŸŽ¯ Test the New Drag & Drop Feature

### 1. **Start a conversation:**
```
Hi! I'm John Smith and I need help with my 2024 tax return. I'm filing as Single with no dependents.
```
**Expected**: Agent should respond naturally and mention drag-and-drop for file uploads

---

### 2. **Ask about W-2:**
```
I have my W-2 form ready. How do I upload it?
```
**Expected**: Agent should say "Please drag and drop your W-2 form directly into this chat"

---

### 3. **Test Drag & Drop:**
- **Drag a PDF/JPG file** over the chat input area
- **Should see**: Blue highlight and "Drop files here" overlay
- **Drop the file**: Should see file preview above input area
- **Should auto-add**: "I've uploaded: filename.pdf" to your message

---

### 4. **Test Upload Button:**
- **Click the upload button** (ðŸ“¤ icon) next to send button
- **Select files**: PDF, JPG, or PNG under 10MB
- **Should see**: File preview with name and size

---

### 5. **Test File Validation:**
- **Try uploading**: .txt, .docx, or files > 10MB
- **Should see**: Alert about supported formats

---

## ðŸŽ¨ **UI Features**

### **Drag & Drop Visual Feedback:**
- âœ… Blue ring highlight when dragging over input area
- âœ… Overlay with upload icon and instructions
- âœ… "Drop files here - PDF, JPG, PNG (max 10MB)"

### **File Preview:**
- âœ… Shows uploaded files above input area
- âœ… File name, size, and remove button
- âœ… Auto-adds file names to message

### **Input Area Updates:**
- âœ… Placeholder text includes "or drag & drop files..."
- âœ… Upload button (ðŸ“¤) next to send button
- âœ… Wider right padding to fit both buttons

---

## ðŸ”§ **Backend Integration**

The `handleFileUpload` function is ready for integration with your file structure service:

```typescript
const handleFileUpload = async (files: File[]) => {
  // TODO: Upload to file structure service
  // const uploadPromises = files.map(file => uploadToFileStructure(file));
  // await Promise.all(uploadPromises);
}
```

## ðŸš€ **Much Better UX!**

This approach is **much safer and more intuitive** than agent-triggered dialogs:

- âœ… **Natural**: Users expect drag-drop in modern chat interfaces
- âœ… **Safe**: No programmatic file dialogs or security concerns  
- âœ… **Visual**: Clear feedback and file previews
- âœ… **Flexible**: Works with any file type (with validation)
- âœ… **Accessible**: Both drag-drop and click-to-upload options

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Ready to Test!**

1. **Backend is running** with updated agent prompt
2. **Frontend has drag-drop** in chat input area  
3. **Agent will tell users** to drag-drop files
4. **Try the test messages** above to see it in action!

The drag-and-drop chat upload is a much better solution! ðŸŽ‰
