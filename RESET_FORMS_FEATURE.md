# ✅ Reset Forms Feature - Convenient Testing Workflow

## 🎯 Feature Added

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Purpose**: Enable easy testing by resetting filled forms without affecting uploaded documents

---

## 🚀 What Was Added

### 1. **Backend API Endpoints**

**File**: `backend/src/province/api/v1/form_management.py` (NEW)

#### Endpoint 1: Delete Specific Form Type
```python
DELETE /api/v1/forms/delete-filled?user_id={clerk_id}&form_type=1040&tax_year=2024
```

**Purpose**: Delete all versions of a specific form type for a user  
**Use Case**: Reset Form 1040 for testing while keeping other forms

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Deleted 5 filled form(s) for user user_xxx",
  "deleted_count": 5
}
```

#### Endpoint 2: Delete ALL Filled Forms
```python
DELETE /api/v1/forms/delete-all-filled?user_id={clerk_id}
```

**Purpose**: Delete ALL filled forms for a user (all types and years)  
**Use Case**: Complete reset for testing

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Deleted ALL 12 filled form(s) for user user_xxx",
  "deleted_count": 12
}
```

---

### 2. **Frontend UI Integration**

**File**: `frontend/src/components/main-editor/main-editor.tsx`

#### Added Button in Documents Tab:
```
[Refresh] [Delete All] [Reset Forms (1040)]
```

**Button**: "Reset Forms (1040)"
- **Color**: Orange (between blue Refresh and red Delete All)
- **Location**: Documents management tab, top right
- **Action**: Deletes all filled Form 1040 versions for current user
- **Safety**: Confirmation dialog before deletion
- **Feedback**: Shows "Resetting..." during operation
- **Result**: Page reload to refresh Form 1040 viewer

---

## ✅ Clerk User ID Integration

### How User ID is Retrieved:

**Priority Order**:
1. **Debug Info**: `debugInfo?.USER_ID`
2. **Clerk localStorage**: Parse `__clerk_environment` → `value.user.id`
3. **Fallback**: Error message if not found

**Code**:
```typescript
const userId = debugInfo?.USER_ID || 
  (typeof window !== 'undefined' && (() => {
    try {
      const clerkEnv = localStorage.getItem('__clerk_environment');
      if (clerkEnv) {
        const parsed = JSON.parse(clerkEnv);
        return parsed?.value?.user?.id;
      }
    } catch {}
    return null;
  })());

if (!userId) {
  alert('Cannot delete forms: User ID not found');
  return;
}
```

**Result**: Forms are ALWAYS deleted for the logged-in Clerk user, not a hardcoded ID ✓

## 📊 S3 Storage Structure

### Forms are Stored:
```
filled_forms/
  {clerk_user_id}/          ← Actual Clerk ID from logged-in user
    1040/
      2024/
        v001_1040_1760972440.pdf
        v002_1040_1760973001.pdf
        v003_1040_1760973542.pdf
    1099/
      2024/
        v001_1099_...pdf
```

### What Gets Deleted:

**Reset Forms (1040)**:
```
DELETE filled_forms/{user_id}/1040/2024/*
```
- Removes: All Form 1040 versions for 2024
- Keeps: Documents, 1099s, other forms

**Delete All Filled Forms** (if called):
```
DELETE filled_forms/{user_id}/*
```
- Removes: ALL filled forms (all types, all years)
- Keeps: Uploaded documents (W-2s, etc.)

## 🧪 Testing Workflow

### Before (Tedious):
```
1. Upload W-2
2. Chat with agent → Form filled
3. Notice issue
4. Manually delete forms from AWS console or CLI
5. Start over
```

### After (Convenient):
```
1. Upload W-2
2. Chat with agent → Form filled
3. Notice issue
4. Click "Reset Forms (1040)" button ✨
5. Confirm deletion
6. Page reloads → Fresh start!
```

---

## 🎨 UI Design

### Button Appearance:
- **Color**: Orange (`bg-orange-500 hover:bg-orange-600`)
- **Position**: Next to "Delete All" in Documents tab
- **States**:
  - Normal: "Reset Forms (1040)"
  - Loading: "Resetting..."
  - Disabled: Gray (while operation in progress)
- **Tooltip**: "Reset all filled Form 1040 versions for testing"

### User Experience:
1. User clicks "Reset Forms (1040)"
2. Confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to reset ALL filled forms?"
3. Loading state: Button shows "Resetting..."
4. Success alert: "Deleted 3 filled form(s) for user user_xxx"
5. Page reloads automatically
6. Form 1040 viewer shows "No Form 1040 Available"

---

## 🔒 Security

### Ensures Proper User Isolation:
- ✅ Only deletes forms for **logged-in Clerk user**
- ✅ Cannot delete another user's forms
- ✅ Requires user_id parameter (not optional)
- ✅ Validates Clerk user ID exists before deletion
- ✅ S3 paths include user_id for isolation

### Backend Validation:
```python
@router.delete("/delete-all-filled")
async def delete_all_filled_forms(
    user_id: str = Query(..., description="User ID (Clerk ID)")  # Required!
):
    # Only deletes: filled_forms/{user_id}/*
    # Cannot access other users' data
```

---

## 📝 Complete Testing Flow

### Scenario: Test Form Filling Multiple Times

```bash
# Test 1
1. Upload W-2
2. Chat: "Single"
3. Chat: "No dependents"
4. Form fills → Check result

# Reset for Test 2
5. Click "Reset Forms (1040)"
6. Confirm

# Test 2 (same W-2, different status)
7. Chat: "Married filing jointly"
8. Chat: "2 dependents"
9. Form fills → Check result

# Reset for Test 3
10. Click "Reset Forms (1040)"
11. Confirm

# Test 3 (different W-2)
12. Delete W-2 documents
13. Upload new W-2
14. Repeat conversation
```

**Result**: Clean, repeatable testing workflow! 🎉

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Backend:
- **File**: `backend/src/province/api/v1/form_management.py`
- **Router**: Added to `backend/src/province/api/routes.py`
- **Lines**: 171 lines of code
- **Dependencies**: FastAPI, boto3, structlog

### Frontend:
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/main-editor/main-editor.tsx`
- **Function**: `deleteAllFilledForms()`
- **Lines**: ~50 lines added
- **Dependencies**: React, fetch API, localStorage

### Key Code Sections:

**S3 Deletion Loop**:
```python
response = s3_client.list_objects_v2(
    Bucket=bucket,
    Prefix=f"filled_forms/{user_id}/1040/2024/"
)

deleted_count = 0
if response.get('Contents'):
    for obj in response['Contents']:
        s3_client.delete_object(
            Bucket=bucket,
            Key=obj['Key']
        )
        deleted_count += 1
```

**Frontend User ID Extraction**:
```typescript
const userId = debugInfo?.USER_ID || 
  (() => {
    const clerkEnv = localStorage.getItem('__clerk_environment');
    return JSON.parse(clerkEnv)?.value?.user?.id;
  })();
```
